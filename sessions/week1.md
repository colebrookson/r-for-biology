## Week 1

Welcome to the first week of content! Topics of this week will be an introduction to this series, an overview of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and some of the basic programming skills that will form the basis of what we'll learn from here on out.

Please watch the below videos **before** coming to the synchronous lecture - they are relatively short. Follow along when asked, and write down any questions or difficulties you have that we can discuss in lecture.

In future weeks, we'll have a few videos for you to watch that have programming concepts or ideas presented, that we will then practice in our synchronous session. This week, we are just getting you set up to be ready to code, and we'll do everything else together in our session! Looking forward to seeing you all soon!
